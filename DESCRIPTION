Description: An implementation of functions to optimize ordering of nodes in
    a dendrogram, without affecting the meaning of the dendrogram. A dendrogram can
    be sorted based on the average distance of subtrees, or based on the smallest
    distance value. These sorting methods improve readability and interpretability
    of tree structure, especially for tasks such as comparison of different distance
    measures or linkage types and identification of tight clusters and outliers. As
    a result, it also introduces more meaningful reordering for a coupled heatmap
    visualization.
